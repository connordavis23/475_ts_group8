#STOCKS!
  
#Welcome to our shiny app all about visualizing and comparing stocks to 
#help the user make informed decisions about their investments, to gain knowledge 
#about stocks, or to explore their curiosity about stocks.

#Visualizing a Stock: To use this feature the user must first click the arrow 
#under the widget labeled "Select Stock". Next, the user may scroll through the 
#alphabetical list of stock ticker symbols and select their desired stock. This 
#will allow the user to begin to narrow down what information they would like to 
#view. Next, under the “Select Metric” widget, the user can scroll through the 
#options and select a metric to visualize within their selected stock, thus 
#narrowing down their selection further. Next, under the “Select Date Range” 
#widget, the user can choose the date range they would like to view by selecting 
#the left date as the beginning of their range, and the right date as the ending 
#of their range. This allows the user to narrow down their data to the timeframe 
#they would like to view. After selecting all of these, a plot will appear for 
#the user to visualize their selected stock and metric during the selected date range.


#Compare Stocks: To use this feature the user must first click the arrow under the 
#widget labeled "Select Stock". Next, the user may scroll through the alphabetical 
#list of stock ticker symbols and select their desired stock. The user will repeat 
#this step under the second “Select Stock” widget with the stock they would like to 
#compare their first selected stock with. Next, under the “Select Metric” widget, the 
#user can scroll through the options and select a metric to visualize within their 
#selected stocks, thus narrowing down their selection further. Next, under the 
#“Select Date Range” widget, the user can choose the date range they would like to view 
#by selecting the left date as the beginning of their range, and the right date as the 
#ending of their range. This allows the user to narrow down their data to the timeframe 
#they would like to view. After selecting all of these, a plot will appear for the user 
#to visualize their selected stocks and metric during the selected date range for a 
#visual comparison between these stocks.

#Purchase a Stock: To use this feature the user must first click the arrow under the 
#widget labeled "Select Stock". Next, the user may scroll through the alphabetical list 
#of stock ticker symbols and select their desired stock. This will allow the user to

#“How Many Shares?” widget, the user can slide the slider to select how many stocks 
#they would hypothetically like to purchase. Then, under the “Select Buy Date” widget, 
#the user can select the date they would hypothetically buy the stock. Under the 
#“Select New Date” widget, the user can select a date after the buy date where they 
#would sell the stock. This will then output the growth or decline of the stock to see 
#if the stock is worth purchasing.

#View Open and Closed Differences: To use this feature the user must first click the arrow 
#under the widget labeled "Select a Symbol". Next, the user may scroll through the
